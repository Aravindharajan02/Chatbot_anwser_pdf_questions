# Chatbot_anwser_pdf_questions
This chatbot works in the web application streamlit and also i used some pre-defined libraries nltk,PyPDF2, pdfreader. 
This code is like a smart assistant that reads a PDF file. When you upload a PDF, it breaks down all the text into sentences. 
Then, when you ask it something, it finds the most similar sentence in the PDF and tells you what it found. 
It's a basic chatbot that helps you understand and talk about the content of the PDF you uploaded.

This is my task to get pdf file from user and answer the questions about the pdf content.(Touchmark Descience)
