# Chatbot_anwser_pdf_questions
This code is like a smart assistant that reads a PDF file. When you upload a PDF, it breaks down all the text into sentences. Then, when you ask it something, it finds the most similar sentence in the PDF and tells you what it found. It's a basic chatbot that helps you understand and talk about the content of the PDF you uploaded.
